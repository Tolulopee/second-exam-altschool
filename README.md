 Created a counter app by using the react useReducer hook, an error boundary using the react class component. Also made an error boundary that renders whren there is a problem with the page. An Error 404 page was also created by building a seaparate component that is  imported to the app.js file for when the user goes to any page that is  is not built in the app. I used lighthouse to test for accessibility and SEO.
